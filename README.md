# Identifying Ecological Infrastructure
This repository contains R scripts, configuration files and documentation for the identification and update of Ecological Infrastructure (EI), according to the method proposed by [GE21](https://www.ge21.ch/). 
This work has been designed to be used via a shared environment on JupyterHub and sripts have therefore been written to being run in this kind of environment. 

## üìå Overview 
The aim of these scripts is to produce raster layers for each of the indicators (see figure below) used to build the pillars of the EI, and then perform a hierarchical prioritization of all this information in order to identify EI. The users decide on the input data to be used as well as on certain methodological parameters. Then, scripts run appropriate models/softwares to process data and produce documented outputs.
The methodology is implemented through an automated **R-based processing pipeline** which is described in this document.

Our objectives:
- Automate the computation of ecological indicators from heterogeneous datasets
- Centralize data and scripts
- Facilitate regular updates of the EI with minimal user intervention
- Ensure full traceability and reproducibility of results.
This project is part of a broader effort to enhance reproducibility, transparency, and scalability in environmental monitoring and conservation planning.

## üìñ Methodology and references 
The methodology presented here is based on an assessment of the ecological quality of the territory, hereafter named biodiversity diagnosis. The biodiversity diagnosis relies on four pillars, each representing a set of indicators that collectively aim to characterize biodiversity from a specific perspective. To facilitate the integration of these various dimensions of biodiversity, the spatial prioritization tool [Zonation](https://zonationteam.github.io/Zonation5/) is employed to rank each spatial unit. Using an iterative algorithm, each cell across the entire territory is assigned a unique value reflecting its relative importance compared to others. From the biodiversity diagnosis, 30% of the territory with the highest priority score can be determined, forming the Geneva Ecological Infrastructure according to target 3 of the CBD. This represents an area where biodiversity covers the most representative proportion of the selected dimensions to consider in the systematic conservation planning

## üöÄ Getting started
From your `/home` workspace on JupyterLab, open a **terminal** and:

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ALambiel/envirospace_IE
cd envirospace_IE
```
Steps 2 and 3 have to be done both for `rspatial` and `invest3141`.

2. Deploy `rspatial` environment and create associated kernel
```bash
conda env create -f config/rspatial
conda activate rspatial

R
IRkernel::installspec(name = 'rspatial', displayname = 'Spatial analysis with R')
q()
```

3. Deploy `invest3141` environment and create associated kernels
```bash
conda env create -f config/invest3141
conda activate invest3141
pip install natcap.invest==3.14.1

R
IRkernel::installspec(name = 'invest3141r', displayname = 'InVEST 3.14.1 with R')
q()

python -m ipykernel install --user --name invest3141 --display-name "InVEST 3.14.1"
```

4. Run R script

## ü§ù Reproducibility & FAIR Principles
